# Introduction:
The following datasdet shows a history of house sales in Melbourne, Australia.

In this notebook we will try to answer 2 questions:
1. Predicting the price of a house based on the information given in the dataset
2. Predict whether a house has 3 rooms or not

##### Process:
During the analysis process, I will use various Machine Learning supervised algorithms.
The process is made following these steps:
1. Getting familiar with the data - checking for missing values and any abnormal values and noise
2. Preprocess the data so we can feed it to the algorithm
3. Deploy the algorithm
4. Evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of our model while simultaneously improving our feature selection
